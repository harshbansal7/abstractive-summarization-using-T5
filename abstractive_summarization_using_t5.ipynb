        "text = \"\"\"Since their early discovery, thin films have quickly found industrial uses, including in ornamental and optical applications. The range of applications for thin film technology has expanded to the point where nearly every industrial sector now uses it to impart specific physical and chemical properties to the surface of bulk materials. This expansion has been aided by the development of vacuum technology and electric power facilities. Recently, the most technologically sophisticated applications, such microelectronics and biomedicine, have been made possible by the ability to adjust the film properties by the change of the microstructure via the deposition parameters used in a particular deposition procedure. Despite such remarkable advancements, the relationship between all phases of the manufacture of thin films, specifically deposition parameters-morphology and characteristics, is not entirely precise. The development of complex models for an accurate prediction of film properties has been hampered, among other things, by the lack of characterization techniques suited for probing films with thickness less than a single atomic layer and a lack of knowledge of the physics. Additionally, there are still certain challenges with the mass production of advanced structures, such as quantum wells and wires, as well as a relatively high cost for their deposition. Thin film technology will be more competitive for cutting-edge technological applications once these obstacles are removed.\"\"\""

We have executed data from European Space Agency (ESA) and CPCB online portal for air quality data dissemination. The Sentinel e 5 P satellite images elucidate that the Air quality of Indian territory has been improved significantly during COVID-19. Mumbai and Delhi are one of the most populated cities. These two cities have observed a substantial decrease in Nitrogen Dioxide (40e50%) compared to the same period last year. It suggests that the emergence of COVID-19 has been proved to a necessary evil as being advantageous for mitigating air pollution on Indian territory during the lock-down. The study found a significant decline in Nitrogen Dioxide in reputed states of India, i.e., Delhi and Mumbai. Moreover, a faded track of Nitrogen Dioxide can be seen at the Maritime route in the Indian Ocean. An upsurge in the environmental quality of India will also be beneficial for its neighbor countries, i.e., China, Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan.\"\"\")"

Weather is a natural a phenomenon for which forecasting is a great challenge today. Weather parameters such as Rainfall, Relative Humidity , Wind Speed, Air Temperature are highly non-linear and complex phenomena, which include mathematical simulation and modeling for its correct forecasting. Weather Forecasting is use to simplify the purpose of knowledge and tools that are used for the state of atmosphere at a given place. The prediction is becoming more complicated due to changing weather condition. There are different software and types are available for Time Series forecasting. Our aim is to analyze the parameters and do the comparison of some strategies in predicting these temperatures. Here we tend to analyze the data of given parameters and notice the prediction for few period using the strategy of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing (ETS).The data from meteorological centers are taken for comparison of methods using packages such as ggplot2, forecast, time Date in R and automatic prediction strategies are available within the package applied for modeling with ARIMA and ETS methods. On basis of accuracy we tend to attempt the simplest Methodology. Our model will compare on basis of MAE, MASE, MAPE AND RMSE. The identification of model will chromatic inspection of both the ACF and PACF to hypothesize many possible models will estimated by selection criteria AIC, AICc and BIC.\"\"\")"
